  <h1>CHECKERS</h1>
    <h2> A COMP110 Final Project by Emily Heckel and Katherine Buige </h2>
  <p>Our program is CHECKERS: a board game program in which you and a friend can play Checkers against one another. </p>

    <h3>110 Concepts Used</h3>
    <p>In our project, we utilized: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2D arrays</li>
      <li>If/then/else statements</li>
      <li>Nested for loops</li>
      <li>Scenebuilder</li>
      <li>Object oriented programming</li>
      <li>Javafx elements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges Overcome </h3>
    <li>Getting the piece to move</li>
    <li>Getting the previous piece to disappear</li>
    <li>Equation for jumping over pieces and adding points</li>
    <li>Making the game turn-based</li>
    <h3>Video!</h3>
    <h3>Individual contributions<h3>
      <h4>Emily:</h4>
      <li>Figuring out turn based system</li>
      <li>Typing and formatting</li>
      <li></li>
      <h4>Katherine:</h4>
      <li>Figuring out jumping equation</li>
      <li>Putting the rules button in place</li>
      <p>But really, a lot of the work was us saying "hey maybe doing this would work" and the other saying "omg yeah" then figuring it out together. We worked so much as a focused team that it's hard to divide the work we did up into who-did-what!!</p>
      <h3>Main goal:</h3>
      <li>Making a playable game of checkers.... done</li>
      <h4>Sub-goals:</h4>
      <li>Getting points to work!!</li>
      <li>Getting turns to work!!</li>
      <h3>Goals outstanding</h3>
      <li>Restricting moves to legal moves (right now, we have vague limits, but you can jump too far sometimes and jump over nothing)</li>
      <li>Fixing a bug that only sometimes, when you jump over nothing, it adds points anyway</li>
      <li>Not allowing pieces to move backwards when they aren't a king (therefore, the game will no longer be no-rules checkers :'-( )</li>
